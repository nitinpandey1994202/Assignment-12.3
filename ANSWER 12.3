Question:-
1)  What is meant by FlumeNG ?
2)  Can Flume provides 100 % reliability to the data flow?
3)  Can Flume can distributes data to multiple destinations?
4)  Explain about the different channel types in Flume. And which channel type is
faster?

ANSWER:-

1)basically flume NG is new major revision of flume-
 1)Apache Flume is a distributed, reliable, and available system for efficiently collecting, aggregating and moving large 
amounts of log data from many different sources to a centralized data store. Flume is currently undergoing incubation at 
The Apache Software Foundation. Flume NG is work related to new major revision of Flume Prior to entering the incubator, 
Flume saw incremental releases leading up to version 0.9.4. As Flume became adopted it became clear that certain design 
choiceswould need to be reworked in order to address problems reported in the field.The work necessary to make this change 
begana few months ago under the JIRA issue FLUME-728.This work currently resides on a separate branch by the name flume-728,
and is informally referred to as Flume NG. At the time of writing this post Flume NG had gone through two internal milestones
– NG Alpha 1, and NG Alpha 2 and a formal incubator release of Flume NG is in the works.

 2)To solve certain known issues and limitations, Flume requires a refactoring of some core classes and systems. This bug is a parent issue to track the development
of a "Flume NG" - a poorly named, but necessary refactoring. Subtasks should be added to track individual systems and components.
 
 3)This is a large and far reaching set of tasks. The intent is to perform this work in a branch as to not disrupt immediate releases or short term forthcoming
 releases while still allowing open development in the community.
 
 4)Flume NG's high level architecture solidifies a few concepts from Flume OG and drastically simplifies others. As our goals state,
 we are focused on a streamlined codebase that meets the common use cases in a "batteries included," easy to use, easy to extend package.
 Flume NG retains Flume OG's general approach to data transfer and handling.
 
2)
YES,it gives 100% realiability, Apache Flume provides end to end reliability because of its transactional path approach in data flow.
 
3)YES, it support multiplexing flow . The event flows from one sources to multiple channels and multiple destinations . 
It’s achieved by defining a flow multiplexer.

4)It is of three types:-
MEMORY Channel – Events are read from the source into memory and passed to the sink.
JDBC Channel – JDBC Channel stores the events in an embedded Derby database.
FILE Channel –File Channel writes the contents to a file on the file system after reading the event from a source. 
              The file is deleted only  after the contents are successfully delivered to the sink.
MEMORY Channel - memory channel is the fastest channel among the three however has the risk of data loss. The channel that you
                 choose completely depends on the nature of the big data application and the value of each event.
